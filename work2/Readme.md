Logistic regression
 - Implement logistic function
 - Given the test data, fit logistic regression over the categorical values.
 - `Classify` the unknown data using the fitted function.
 - For a change, lets implement this in C++ ! 
   - C++ standard library will be enough, No additional library is needed. 
   - We can output the plot in an html+ js (e.g. d3.js) or svg file, and open the html/svg in a browser to see the plot. This will remove necessity of any plotting library.
   - Be careful to write well organised readable code (short functions, readable function/variable names)
